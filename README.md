## Alexa Skills Practice
I followed [Makers Academy's Alexa series](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/001e7537-6702-4b58-b0d7-cbaed3a9ab3c/makers-academy-s-alexa-series-how-to-model-alexa-using-object-oriented-ruby) to learn how to model Alexa using Object-Orientated Ruby.

The overarching objective was to have a well-tested framework for working with Alexa using Sinatra and Ruby.
